    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>
      Inter-symbol interference (ISI) is simulated by adding a random amount of noise to each symbol's position 
      during the animation. This means that the symbols will not be perfectly aligned with each other, and some 
      symbols may overlap or appear shifted in position due to the added noise.</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>
      To observe the effect of ISI, enter a binary data sequence into the input field and click the "Transmit" 
      button to see the animation of the symbols being transmitted. If ISI is occurring, you should be able to 
      see some symbols appear shifted or overlapped in position due to the added noise. This effect may be more 
      noticeable if you enter a longer binary data sequence or if you increase the amount of noise added to each symbol.</b></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>
      In general, the effect of ISI can be observed in any transmission system where symbols are transmitted over a 
      channel with limited bandwidth or with noise or interference. The presence of ISI can lead to errors in the 
      received symbols, which can impact the overall performance and reliability of the system.</b>
